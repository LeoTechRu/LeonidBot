"""Entry point for the FastAPI application used in tests.

This module exposes a single ``app`` instance that combines the
authentication routes defined in :mod:`web` with the routers from the
``web.routes`` package.  Historically the project provided ``main.py`` at
repository root; tests and external scripts still import ``main``.  After
refactoring the web application moved under the ``web`` package, so this
file restores the expected import path.
